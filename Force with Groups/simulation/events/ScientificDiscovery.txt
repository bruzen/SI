Description = For years we have wondered why those scientists spend so much time in underground tunnels mumbling about quarks and mesons, but today a major scientific discovery was announced concerning new particles, colliders and other physics mumbo-jumbo. While its true that teleportation and hyperspace aren't with us yet, this is still great news for high tech industry and a superb payoff for such an educated workforce.
