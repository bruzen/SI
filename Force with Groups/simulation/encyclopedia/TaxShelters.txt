Tax shelters is the term the game uses for all those tax measures that benefit the super-rich and reduce their tax liabilities. One method to do this is a 'Tax haven' which is a place where taxes are low or even non existent, and where large sums of money can be kept without investigation by the state for tax purposes. Switzerland is often used by wealthy individuals in this way, as are some small islands such as the English Channel islands and Jersey. 
There is a complex web of varying rules and rates affecting the way wealthy people pay tax throughout the world. Ireland used to not tax the foreign income of artists and authors at all, and the UK has a bizarre system for 'non-domiciled' citizens which allows them to almost entirely avoid paying tax depending on where they are claiming to live. (The UK law considers someone resident for tax purposes if they are in the UK for 91 days or more on average over 4 years). The tiny European country of Andorra has zero personal income tax, as does Monaco.

The hugely successful rock band 'the rolling stones' are some of the worlds most famous (and creative) tax-avoidance experts. In 2006 it was reported that earnings over 20 years amounting to £242 million ended up being liable to just 1.6% tax. They originally banked their money in Holland, as there was no Dutch tax on royalties, and also have offices in the Caribbean. The same financial director now represents anti-poverty campaigners U2.
