The history of Trade unions is somewhat hard to pin down, as in many ways they grew out of the 'guilds' with the start of the Industrial revolution in Great Britain. In 1866, the 'national labour union' was formed in the United States, the first US trade union, to be followed by the 'Knights of Labour' and  the 'American federation of Labour'.
The Teamsters is one of the largest and most famous unions in the modern United States. It's full title is 'The International Brotherhood of Teamsters', derived from it's original name of 'International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America', which refers back to when its members drove a team of horses or a mule train. The teamsters grew heavily during the 30s and 40s and reached 1 million members in 1949. In 1957, the Union elected Jimmy Hoffa as it's president. Hoffa achieved substantial victories for the union but his leadership was tainted by his connections to organized crime. He disappeared in 1975.
