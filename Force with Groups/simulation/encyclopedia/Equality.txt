A popular method for calculating the level on inequality in a country is called the Gini Coefficient, or Gini Index, where a value of 1 represents total inequality (1 person has everything) and 0 represents total equality, where everyone's income is the same. The current Gini index values for selected countries are as follows:<BR>
	Denmark:		0.23
	France:		0.26
	Germany:		0.28
	India:		0.32
	Australia		0.35
	United Kingdom: 	0.36
	Russia:		0.40
	Iran:		0.43
	China:		0.44
	United States:	0.45
	Mexico:		0.54
	South Africa:	0.59
	Namibia:   		0.70

A different way to measure inequality is the amount of income earned by the richest 10% in each country. Figures below:
<BR>
	Sweden:		20.1%
	Germany:		23.7%
	France:		25.1%
	United Kingdom:	27.7%
	United States:	30.5%
