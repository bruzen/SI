UK Faith Schools
There are currently 7,000 faith schools in the UK, 6,955 are Christian, 36 Jewish, 5 Muslim and 2 Sikh. A poll in 2005 showed that 64% of the British public opposed state funding for faith schools. The UK govt insists that state supported faith schools teach the national curriculum. In November 2006, the UK government changed the law to allow faith schools to discriminate on religious grounds in the appointment of head teachers, something that is illegal in the UK in normal circumstances.
