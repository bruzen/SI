guiname = Ban livestock Imports

[option0]
Name = Reject Ban
Description = There is no statistical or scientific basis for a blanket ban on livestock imports from that country. The outbreak is highly contained and poses little real risk. This will be an unpopular move overseas, which will be seen as blatant protectionism. This would be an unfair and unjustified embargo of foreign goods.

[option1]
Name = Approve Ban
Description = It's just not worth the risk, however slight it may be, of us importing this disease to our country. The only way to deal with it is the mass slaughter of cattle, and our agricultural industry would not survive that. This may seem over cautious, but better to be safe than sorry. If the situation was reversed, they would do the same to us.
