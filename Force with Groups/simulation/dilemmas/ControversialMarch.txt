Name = Ban the march
Description = The police have given us a good enough reason to ban this march. We must take into account the views of the vast majority of our society who do not want or need the violence and trouble this march will cause. Freedom of speech does not mean freedom to riot. Ban this march.

[option1]
Name = Allow the march
Description = One of the basic freedoms in our society must be the right to freely assemble and put forward a political view, even if it is an unpopular or minority view. The marchers are only expressing their views, and opponents are free to make a peaceful protest. It is an awkward situation but banning a political demonstration is a very dictatorial thing to do.
