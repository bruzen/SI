Description = For years people have complained about under-investment in our rail network and today they were vindicated when a packed commuter train came off the rails at high speed. At least 15 people have been killed and over a hundred injured, but its likely that this will be a sore point with every rail commuter in the country. It would be difficult to put off investment in the rail system under these circumstances
