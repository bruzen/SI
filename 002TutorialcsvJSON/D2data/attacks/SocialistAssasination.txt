Our brave soldiers attacked the very heart of the capitalist machine by opening fire in the middle of a speech to the banking community. A number of evil fascists were killed as well as the so-called 'president' of our country. Sadly, all the comrades involved in this heroic battle have been killed by government forces. This is a victory for the common man, and game over for you.");
