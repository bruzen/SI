Some countries legislate to prevent people working too many hours. the EU has a 'Working Time Directive' passed in 1993 limiting the working week to 48 hours and insisting on a minimum rest period of 11 hour in any 24 hour period. France has stricter legislation, but the UK has the ability for it's workers to 'opt-out' of the clause.
