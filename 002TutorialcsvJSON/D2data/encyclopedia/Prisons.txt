Does prison work? In 2003, the figures for the UK showed that 61% of offenders were reconvicted within 2 years. Statistics show (in the UK) that re offending rates can be cut to 30% where good drug treatment and post-release monitoring systems are in place. Poor literacy amongst prisoners is also an issue. In the UK, more than 50% of all prisoners are at or below the level expected of an 11-year-old in reading.  80% are below this level in writing (Source: Prison Statistics England and Wales 2002, Home Office, 2003)
