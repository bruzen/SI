UK<BR>
In the UK, in 2007, child benefit was paid at a rate of £18.10 per week for the first child, plus £12.10 per week for subsequent children. This payment is not 'means tested' so everyone is entitled to it, regardless of income. The benefit (under a different name) has been in force since 1945.<BR>
In 1993 the UK government created the 'child support agency'. This new agency was given the task of tracking down absent parents in order to enforce the payment of child 'maintenance' to the child's remaining guardian. The CSA became very unpopular, and an independent body was set up in 1997 just to handle complaints about it. In 2004, audits showed that only 76% of CSA maintenance decisions were accurate. In November 2005 it was discovered that for every £1.85 recovered by the CSA from absent parents, £1 was spent on administration. In 2006, it was announced that the CSA would be replaced.<BR>
IRELAND<BR>
Ireland also has child benefit, paid at the rate of 160 euros a month. It also has an 'early childcare supplement' for children under 6 worth 1000 euros per child per year.<BR>
USA<BR>
The laws covering child support in the US vary on a state by state basis. In 2004, 14 million US parents had custody of children under 21 where the other parent lived elsewhere. 83.1% of the custodial parents were mothers. Overall, 26.7% of children (under 21) were in custodial-parent families. Roughly 54% of custodial parents had full time jobs, 28% worked part time and the rest were not employed. In 2003, 24% of custodial parents and their children were living below the official poverty line. <BR>
In 2004, 60% of custodial parents had an agreement in place for financial support from the other parent. although only 45% of these parents did not miss a single payment. In 2003, the total child support due in the USA was $37 Billion, of which $25.4 Billion was actually received.<BR>
In 1986, the 'Bradley amendment' was passed, which aimed to strengthen and co-ordinate the law regarding forcing absent parents to pay owed child support.The penalty for a first offence was a fine or 6 months imprisonment, with this rising to 2 years imprisonment for further offences.
