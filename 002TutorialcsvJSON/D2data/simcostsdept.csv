Policy Name,Department,mincost,maxcost
Lifespan,"A general indicator for the health of your citizens that measures not just raw lifespan, but also fitness and the general wellbeing of people",1,"Retired_freq,-0.3+(0.6*x)"
Literacy,"A measurement of the level of education of the average citizen. Not only literacy, but numeracy and general understanding of everything from history to IT and science",1,"WorkerProductivity,-0.2+(x*0.4)"
Crime,"An indicator of the level of general non violent crime in your nation. This includes crimes such as car crime, burglary etc, but also covers fraud and other similar crimes",0,"_All_,0-(0.13*x)"
Violent Crime,"A more worrying indicator than the overall crime level, this measures the frequency of violent crimes such as murder, rape and muggings. Violent crime is a worry for everyone in the country.",0,"_All_,0-(0.16*x)"
Poverty,"One of the most widely used measures of comparison between nations. The poverty level is periodically reassessed, but all nations should strive to get their poverty rate as low as possible.",0,"Poor,0.3-(x^2)"
Average Income,"A simple measurement of the average wage or income for your citizens. This statistic can be misleading because of the effect of inequality, the average income may be very different to the income of most of your citizens in an unequal society",1,
Equality,"There are many ways to measure equality. Conservatives talk of equality of opportunity, socialists talk of equality of outcome. This is just a simple measurement of the distribution of wealth, financial equality of outcome.",1,"Socialist,-0.3+(0.6*x)"
Air Quality,"A general measurement of the quality of the environment, including air quality, but also measuring noise pollution, litter, water quality and many other measures of pollution",1,"Environmentalist,-0.4+(0.8*x)"
Working Week,"The number of hours worked on average by your citizens in a week. In a fluctuating economy, this may vary from the contracted hours as people give into pressure to work unpaid or paid overtime to keep their jobs. To employees, shorter hours are seen as a good thing",0,"TradeUnionist,0.1-(0.1*x)"
Internet Access,This measures the percentage of your population with access to the internet at home. It is seen as a useful yardstick for measuring the level of IT literacy of a population,1,"WorkerProductivity,0.2*(x^4)"
Car Usage,"A measure of how many miles per year the average household travels by car. High car usage can cause pollution, but are inevitable in a booming economy with poor provision of public transport",0,"AirQuality,0-(0.22*x)"
Productivity,"The average output in financial terms of a typical citizen. Some nations have more productive employees than others, due to such factors as work ethic, technical knowledge and level of income",1,"GDP,-0.18+(x*0.36)"
Unemployment,At its simplest this is a count of the percentage of your population who aren't in gainful employment. Adjusted to omit those citizens who are not actively seeking work for one reason or another,0,"WorkingWeek,0+(0.2*x)"
CO2 Emissions,"Amount of carbon we put into the atmosphere. Environmentalists and the majority of scientists agree that limiting our C02 Emissions is a vital step we should take to fight climate change. Failing to control our emissions can lower our international standing and affect foreign relations. A booming economy, if unchecked, will produce more carbon, as will high levels of car and air travel. There are a vast range of different strategies that can be employed to minimise the level of C02 emissions",0,"ForeignRelations,0-(0.1*x)"
Air Travel,"Air travel is often strongly linked to a countries economy, and thus GDP. Wealthier citizens take more foreign holidays, and a richer economy will mean more business air travel, and more products shipped by air freight. The amount of air travel is very price sensitive, so changes in fuel costs, taxes and other charges can have a major effect.",0,"CO2Emissions,0+(0.1*x)"
Immigration,"Immigration measures the number of people entering this country, both legally and illegally, with the intent of making this their new home. Immigration is generally caused by a strong economy, as those living in poorer countries seek out employment and a higher standard of living. Immigration can be reduced by border controls, and specific measures to set immigration quotas. Too much immigration too fast can lead to racial tensions developing.",0,"RacialTension,0.92*(x^3),2"
Energy Efficiency,"This is a general measure of how efficiently the country uses its energy resources. Low car energy standards, and a lack of investment in new technology will mean a wasteful economy, and in turn, higher demand for fossil fuels such as oil. Reducing energy usage has become more urgent in recent times due to concerns about climate change, and the drive to reduce C02 emissions",0,"GDP,0+(0.05*x)"
Racial Tension,"The degree to which there is unease between different nationalities and cultures. Sudden, uncontrolled immigration can sometimes lead to racial tensions, which can in the worst case, result in violent clashes.",0,"ViolentCrimeRate,0.45*(x^6)"
Foreign Relations,"Foreign relations are important for two reasons, firstly as a way of preventing disputes escalating into wars or terrorism which may threaten our citizens, and secondly, as a way to ensure trade relation are good and that we benefit economically from trade and tourism with other nations.",1,"InternationalTrade,0+(0.5*x),2"
International Trade,"International trade is generally good for an economy, due to the law of comparative advantage, effectively helping each country to produce what it is best at. Trade can be restricted by political problems with other countries, where arguments can lead to import tariffs and sanctions. In some cases, countries also indulge in 'protectionism' to defend politically sensitive industries against foreign competition.",1,"GDP,0+(0.22*x)"
Oil Demand,"Our demand for oil comes from industry, road travel and air travel. The more our citizens fly and drive, the greater our demand for oil, although energy efficiency measures and hybrid cars can reduce this somewhat, as can investments in cleaner industry and renewable energy sources.",0,"OilPrice,0.+(0.5*x)"
Oil Supply,"Our oil supplies can only really be expanded by opening up new parts of our territory for drilling, which can be politically and ecologically difficult. Together with the oil demand, the supply sets the price, which has a strong effect on our economy.",0,"OilPrice,0-(0.5*x)"
Oil Price,"The oil price affects the economy, with higher prices lowering our general standard of living, although this will be mitigated by energy efficiency measures. A lower level of oil dependence will also make us less sensitive to global oil price shocks caused by political instabilities.",0,"GDP,0.22-(0.4*x)"
Terrorism,hidden,0,
Poor Earnings,"The effective income of those people who are on low (or no) earnings in our society. If this value rises high enough (through benefits and tax exemptions for the poor), then more people will move out of poverty and in to the middle income group. Progressive taxation, combined with minimum income guarantees and state benefits are the most popular ways to 'lift people' out of poverty.",0,"CarUsage,0.1*(x^3)"
Middle Earnings,"The effective income of those people on average earnings, not wealthy or poor. This is generally the largest group of people in the economy, so policies which affect this value can be big vote deciders. Middle income earners are expected to own their own homes (or be buying them), and often own one or more cars. They probably take holidays abroad at least once a year. Taxes that affect any of these will hit these people hardest, and may push some of them down into poverty",0,"CarUsage,0.2*(x^3)"
High Earnings,"The effective income of the top earners in society. It is easy to reduce this by punitive taxes on the wealthy, their property, inheritance and activities such as air travel that they often indulge in. It is also possible to benefit them by offering tax exemptions and loopholes for the rich, or by favouring regressive taxation such as sales tax, rather than progressive income taxes.",0,"CarUsage,0.2*(x^2)"
GDP,"The Gross Domestic product of your country. This is defined as The total market value of all the goods and services produced within the nation in a year. This is a good general-purpose measure of the strength of your economy, and the nations overall wealth. One of the contributing factors is the global economic cycle, which tends to be cyclical, and is beyond your control.",1,"Capitalist,-0.2+(1.0*x)"
