guiname = positive discrimination
description = There are calls for a law to expressly set quotas for the employment of ethnic and other minorities by large corporations and government institutions. This would put pressure on companies to give higher priority to some job candidates than others on the basis of their race, sex or age.

Name = Pass law
Description = We need this law. In economic terms it makes no sense for people below or above a certain age to be rendered unemployable. Also, in human rights terms, this is much needed compensation for years of discrimination in the workplace against ethnic minorities, women, the elderly and the disabled.

[option1]
Name = Reject Law
Description = This is a deeply flawed law. It makes no sense to fight discrimination by using discrimination. It creates two problems, that of the minority members who feel they may not have achieved the position on merit, and the resentment of the potential employee who was denied the job.
