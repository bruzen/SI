guiname = Land mine ban

Name = Ban land mines
Description = Land mines cause so many civilian deaths that there really is no way we should condone the manufacture of such weapons. They are a crude weapon dating back to the first world war and there is no justification for their use today. If banning these weapons costs us a handful of jobs then that's a price we should be happy to pay.

[option1]
Name = Reject law
Description = Its very easy to say we should ban the manufacture of land mines, but what next? stop making guns? handcuffs? This would be a step towards dismantling our whole arms industry which would cost jobs and hurt investor confidence. It's not the job of the state to interfere in what products a company manufactures.
