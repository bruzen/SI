Name = Turn down offer
Description = This foreign leader has an appalling record on both human rights, and attitudes to non-whites within his country. There will be widespread anger amongst both ethnic minorities, and human rights campaigners in this country, and the international community if you carry out the visit, which is effectively an endorsement of this mans brutal policies.

[option1]
Name = Accept offer
Description = The visit should go ahead. Firstly it would be great for the economy, potentially creating jobs amongst the very minorities who oppose the visit, secondly we cannot possibly influence the behavior of other nations if we refuse even to meet with their leaders.
