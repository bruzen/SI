Name = Ban flag burning
Description = Many people are insulted by the thought of people burning the flag of their nation. The flag does not represent a specific political party, it represents the country itself.

Name = Allow flag burning
Description = We cannot claim to be a free society whilst at the same time denying the right of people who oppose our government to express that view, even if that means burning the flag.
