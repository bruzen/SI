name = SameSexmarriage
guiname = Ban same sex marriage
description = Until recently this hasn't been an issue, marriage has been a straightforward issue and a ceremony reserved for heterosexual couples, but increasingly the more liberal ministers have been carrying out same sex marriages. Should we ban this at the constitutional level?

Name = Ban it
Description = It's crazy to allow this travesty of a religious ceremony to take place. By standing by and doing nothing we are silently condoning the practice. The church will be outraged if we don't move quickly to put a stop to this.

[option1]
Name = Allow marriages
Description = There are no good reasons to ban such marriages. It's no business of the state to interfere in the relationships between loving couples regardless of their gender. Placing a ban on the kinds of relationships our citizens can form is an unforgivable intrusion into peoples private lives.
