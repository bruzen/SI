Name = Block Merger
Description = The whole idea of the free market is based on competition. Allowing these two firms to merge will reduce both competition, and consumer choice and no doubt lead to redundancies. Its another example of government looking after big business and forgetting the little guy. Small businesses and Trade unionists urge you to block this merger.
