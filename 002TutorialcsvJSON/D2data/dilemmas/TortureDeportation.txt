Name = Deport him
Description = This man has nobody to blame for his situation but himself. He arrived here illegally, and has operated as a criminal since he got here. If he had claimed political asylum when he arrived and not began a life of crime it would be a different matter. In the circumstances we must take his claims of torture threats with a pinch of salt.

[option1]
Name = Keep him here
Description = It's clear that this man is hardly a model citizen, but no confidence trickster deserves to be tortured. If we truly oppose the use of torture on principle, then despite the mans history, we need to ensure we are not willing participants to torture by sending him back home. If we deport him, it could effectively become a death sentence.
