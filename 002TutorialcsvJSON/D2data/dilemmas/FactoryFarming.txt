Name = Set tougher standards
Description = It's about time we did something to ensure animals are not suffering in intensive farming. Most people would be horrified if they saw the conditions some animals are kept in. These standards would lead to more expensive food, but people would be happy to pay more if they knew the conditions in which animals are currently kept.

[option1]
Name = Leave unchanged
Description = Nobody forces people to buy processed meat from the cheapest source. There are organic and free range foods, but the free market shows clearly that people aren't prepared to pay more for a change in animal welfare. This is the government interfering in the market to appease a few campaigners.
